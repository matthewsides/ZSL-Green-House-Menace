## Project Management [1]

### Introduction [1.1]

This document specifies a project management plan and design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “Greenhouse Menace”, commissioned by the Zoological Society of London. It is based on elements discussed in various meetings, held since 2nd October, between cliental (ZSL) and group members involving Matthew, Sam, Joe, Luke and Luke.

### Scope [1.2]

This documentation is meant to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of “Greenhouse Menace”. The App is for a target age of 12-15 year olds, along with this the app has to be very informative and interactive, ZSL required these for the app to be successful.

### OverView [1.3]

The origins of this project, stemmed from the participation in a competition that sought the backing and presence of a collective of  educational institutes invited by the renowned organisation ZSL, that tasked each institute with formulating a rendidition of there written idea's, concieved from  the idea of modernising their presentations and style in which information is conveyed to kids.

This sought the seperation or partition of colleagues into groups to better optimise work and ensure an enviroment of a competitive nature and thus also allow for a multitude of choices to be avaliable to ZSL when they choose the application and respective choice, that better suits their needs.

Moreover the chosen subject in regards to which they wished to convey or focus on, is global warming or inparticular green house  gases honing in on the green house gas chain and production in particular, whilst still briefly covering the impact. Their reasoning behind this is because the production is often the part that is the root cause for all problems displayed in the impact, which is generally covered more in education, rather than how to fix the problems already occured, ZSL hope to cover how to prevent the reoccuring problems before they come to fruition.

Furthermore ZSL has stated that they would prefer 4 geographical areas or types of terrain to be covered and be the reoccuring theme in the application, to highlight the impact the manufacturing  proccess has on these areas as resources are ransacked for production, whilst also suiting the presentation and display already presented and covered during their class program (Meet ZSL Theme).

The application ultimately due to limitations and constraints to the technoology avaliable to, and provided by ZSL has been requested to be programmed to fucntion specifically for IPAD, since it is all they have on hand and is a portable system that is easily accessable and user friendly (whether it will be hosted by a database online or through the app store is undisclosed and still open for disscussion/negotiation).

### Goals and Team Roles

The Overall goal of the project is to design,present and create a demo of an application based around (ZSL's Specifications) the Green house gas chain, production and impact on the envirioment, essentialy satisfying the clients needs. This is required to be completed by __ based on whenthe event is scehduled. whilst the milestones that are required to be completed along the way in order to meet said goal consist of :

 Formulate a conceptual design based around the Client brief and prior discussed points.Thereafter presenting the design to the client (ZSL) , gathering feedback and reviewing the outcome to the given brief to assess as to whether the design met the expected outcome level. Through creating and presenting a conceptual design for the application it may be used to measure how close to the mark the current design is in comparision to the clients application idea, thus relevant to building upon the current design. The initial design should be finished by ___ since that is when the second meeting (subsequently the first meeting was for requirment gathering and an introduction to the subject) is scheduled to take place, whilst once improved another meeting is set to be held on ____, at _____.

 Create a working demo based on the pre-concieved design using a game engine and chosen coding language, to present to ZSL for quality assurance, that the group is capable of undertaking the task further if requested  and to better demonstrate and convey are ideas and interpretation of there specifications during a presentation. With regards to ensuring the measurability in relation to the completion and success, the previously mentioned presentation that will be shown during the event, may be used to weigh the success based on the clients reactions to the product. Whilst the demo may be tested and compared to the noted client specifications to determine whether the application is suitable. The demo inprinciple ties into the key responsibility of ensuring (quality assurance) that the client is presented with a design and functional prototype of an application, which would have been furthered had the group been chosen as the main contractor for there event. Following said notion that this demo is for the event it should be functional and complete by ____, to avoid complications.

 The attendence of a pre-scheduled event and subsequence showcasing of the design through the format of a presentation and demo.This event is set to be held at WhipeSnade ZOO owned by the zoological society of london and must be attended on the ___ , for the sole reason of presenting an application and concluding said competition held by ZSL and partaken by numerous educational insitutes as well as other students that are colleagues coupled into seperate groups. Following attendance, the extent in which this milestone and the overall goal was met may be gauged with an evaluation based on the outcome (If everyone was present and ZSL's final decision as to whether they would like to continue working inconjunction with us on the project). 

Team Roles-

The roles listed next to each group member below are their primary roles, however due to the fluidity and flexability of the group the roles were interchangable with certain group members taking on secondary roles either to allieveate pressure on another group member or due to completion of their tasks. This structure and method is further supported, due to the application of SCRUM, (an agile framework that places empahasis on software development)  as the group took on a different composition than a traditonal waterfall project, allowing the team to be cross functional, enabling effective team collaboration.

 Luke.S - Team Leader / Scrum Master

  Sam - Product Owner

 Luke.B - Lead Graphics Designer

 Matthew.S - Lead Programmer

 Joe.W - Developer

### Aims and Objectives [1.4]

	Create an app based around a Green House Gas Chain

	Produce and Implement a Drag and Drop System

	Satisfy client requirements to an acceptable standard

	Incorporate 4 areas based around geographical terrain 

	Make the app functional and compatible in said target system (I pad)

	Produce a demo and present ideas to the client (based on the clients specifications)

### Costs [1.5]

The expenditure of the project amounts to approximately £597.95, this is primarily due to software costs (unity), a tool set to be used in the development of the application. Whilst the secondary reason is due to the inclusion or requirement of a Mini Bus/Van rented and used for the transportation of an event, pertaining to the demonstration of the conceptual phase and demo of the application “Greenhouse Menace” to the client.
In addition, graphics were procured for the implementation and aesthetic of the application, though no additional costs were required since all the graphics were found in the free domain and eventually altered by are graphic designer Luke, with minor altercations and additions taken from the unity store (UI Graphics listed as free) during implementation by the lead programmer Matthew.


| ID | Description | Amount |	Expenses |	Total |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1	|Unity Software|	5     |	£447.95	 |        |

### Quality Assurance Preface[1.6]

The purpose of Reboot Games and are group development team is to provide an acceptable application that caters to said clients specifications, giving  internal quality assurance guidance. 
This will be attained through notifying clients during the development ensuring ZSL is kept up to date, further doing tests throughout the production of said application, ensuring functionality, ease of use and that the application meets the standards expected by the client.
Following the tests that will ensue, prototypes and demos will be formulated, to garner notice and consideration, showcasing the groups capabilities , whilst also enabling the client to view progress and gain a better understanding of how the final product will function and look.
In addition schedules will be drafted, with the project being delegated into tasks that have a set time frame in which to be completed, allowing more deliberation, testing segments rather than the whole application making it easier to locate flaws within the system and delegate tasks, thus improving the whole project infrastructure and making the project more organised and time efficient.
The above methods will better ensure quality assurance and that the application meets client standards and suits their needs, further involving the client in the development ensuring smooth communication and structured organisation.

### Time (Gantt Chart)[1.7]

![First Gantt](https://github.com/matthewsides/ZSL-Green-House-Menace/blob/master/Gantt_Chart_ZSL.png)




### Communication [1.8]

The steps the group is taking to ensure fluent communication consists of the usage of numerous platforms, for instance facebook messenger for text based chat, discord for audio based communication and email for whether any documentation needs to be sent and verified by other group members.
Furthermore other forms of communication consist of verbal and face to face, setting up meetings throughout the development to ensure that the group is not replicating and regurgitating  similar pieces of work.
In addition making sure that the group is on schedule and meeting certain set standards, leaving time for a review of work concurrently completed during said time frame. The current times the group is set to meet up have not yet been disclosed other than it would be during the half term in which the location will be Watford, West Herts College. Though the meeting is likely to take place during the duration of three days, with members attending; Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 

### Risks [1.9]

|ID	|Risks	Category|Level|	Probability	|Effect	|Mitigation|
|----|-------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|
|1	|Misinterpretation of Client's ideas| 	Medium|	40%|	The foremost effect would be that after the second meeting showcasing the projects progress thus far, the client would either drop the project or call for a re evaluation of their requirements.|	Communication would be the method of mitigation in regards to this risk, further assuring the client, thereafter re- organising the team and evaluating the current position of the project and where it needs to be with regards to meeting the clients standards, planning the next course of action, not wholly scraping the original ideas but also not using it as the basis.|
|2|	Misconstruction of the game engine|	Low|	15%|	Unity, the currently elected game engine to be used in the development of said application, could wrought appalling effects on the projects outcome if the engines basics are not understood within the time frame provided, causing the project demo to either be delayed or cancelled. 	|Though unlikely since analysis was already undertaken during the consideration of numerous game engines.If the engine appeared to cause inconvenience, the ideal solution would be to find another engine that is compatible with the language applied, transferring any code over to the new engine. |
|3|	Time or not following schedule|	Medium	|30%	|Through not abiding or following a pre revised schedule as well as the times and dates of the events already confirmed outside the groups control.  The problems that occur will link to how efficiently and quickly the project is completed, also affecting the final outcome with regards to the standard the application measures at.|	If a schedule is not being followed the mitigation and alleviation of said problem would be to re-tune the current schedule to meet and suit both the clients and groups needs.|
|4|	Costs or going over the set balance	|Low	|5%	|This would be of major consequence since it would mean that if any more graphics or other resources were needed to be procured the group would be unable to do so.|	Possible mitigation would be to levy and negotiate with the client or organisation for more funds drawing up possible reasons as to why the funding is necessary and how it would benefit them. Whilst with regards to prevention it would be ideal to draw out a plan, deciding what is more essential to the development of the project and transferring resources based on that factor.|

### Resources[1.9.1]

|ID	|Resource Name	|Convention|
|---|---------|----------|
|1	|Unity	|Unity a cross platform game engine, set to be used  during the production of the two dimensional application.|
|2|	Application Graphics|	Resource will be used to improve the overall aesthetic of the application.|
|3	|Visual Studios|	Visual Studios will be the main integrated development environment used for coding.|
|4	|Mini Van|	This resource (Mini Van) is the transport, in which will take the group to the pre-determined event to showcase said application.|
|5	|Microsoft Applications|	The Resource termed "Microsoft applications", pertains specifically to excel, power point and word set to be used in the development of a documentation and presentations.|

### IDE [1.9.2]

In regards to the IDE set to be used in the creation of the application, it was either between notepad++ and visual studios, since that is what the group is most adept at using, whilst both are considerate in regards to layout, tools, etc. and target beginners (with visual studios also targeting other demographics). 

Thereafter now that two IDE's (both text editors) had been chosen it was necessary to decide which one to use, considering in particular the tools as well as the ease of use. In the end visual studios was chosen since it is compatible with unity (works in conjunction and automatically opened attempting to program when in unity) which in itself is a program that provides flexibility, adaptability and overall makes the development easier and more smooth. 

Whilst language was also integral in the decision though as C# was used as the language since it was the only available language in unity that was available to the group at the beginning since other languages aren't  applicable in unity until  a premium subscription is purchased, whilst C# also has some similarities to C++ (the intended/initially proposed language to be applied and used), in addition since not all IDE's may use all programming languages it was necessary to check to ensure that visual studios would be compatible with C#, evidently visual studios does allow the incorporation of C#, whilst notepad++ is compatible with all languages (useful for some circumstances, but not in this instance since visual studios is also compatible).

Moreover linking in with the compatibility point in this project the client wanted the app to be hosted on a website using Ipads to access the website. Therefore it was recommended/decided that WebGL would be used as it is compatible with chrome and can function to an extent in safari, this is also another reason as to why unity was used and the language and IDE was chosen for the development of the application. 

Thereafter the decision was essentially made after evaluating the ease of use, compatibility with other software in use, a comparison of own- self-  knowledge, whether it ran the intended to use language and basically functioned and met with and functioned or worked with the purpose in which the group had in mind (whether it could do what the group intended or wanted it to do)(capability of the software).

### Coding Standards [1.9.3]

Coding standards are version-independent and "always-current". All new code should follow the current standards, regardless of (core) version. Existing code in older versions may be updated, but doesn't necessarily have to be

Note: The coding standards listed below are essentially the set of guidelines,that the group have agree'd upon to follow, during development to ensure that the programming style is consistent.

#### White Spacing and Indentation 

Use an indent of 1-2 spaces, with no tabs.

Lines should have no trailing whitespace at the end. 

#### Operators

All Binary Operators (Operators that come between two values) such as; +, -, *, /, ==, =, etc. should have a space before and after the operator for readability. Example Formatting: i = i rather than i=i.

#### Line length 

In general all lines of code should not be longer than 80 chars.
Though exceptions include when functions names are longer or in the instance that the reason for said length is due to the need for a comment (commenting excluded from this rule, though it is suggested to keep the amount of chars used when commenting to a minimal to ensure the code readability is not affected).

#### Function Calls

Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name, the opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between commas and each parameter, and no space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis, and the semicolon.

For instance: var = num(one, two, three);

#### Arrays

Arrays should include spacing seperating each element (after the comma), including operators.
Note: if the array exceeds the char limit (80), seperate (span) each element, breaking it down into its own line and indented level.

Example:

char_array [
a,  \
b,  \
c,
]

#### Qoutes

There is no specific set standard for whether double or single qoutation marks are used, only that under circumstances consistency should be ensured and attempted to be kept, throughout the code, therefore it is recommended to pick one beforehand and use throughout the code.

#### Naming Conventions

The naming conventions in particular pertaining to functions and variables should be named using lowercase, and words should be separated with an underscore (no-spacing). Variables may also be spaced with Upper case characters.

Examples:

code_example (Functions and Variables) or CodeCoolExample (Variables)

#### Comments

As alliterated above in the length section, comments should be clear and concise using as little characters as possible. The comments are not restricted by the pre-set char limit of 80 and may span for as long as required, though it is recommeded to keep it short to ensure readability.

### Project Backlog [1.9.4]

Group Details

Group Name: Ducks and Bucks

Group Members: Luke Shead, Joe Williams, Sam Dearing, Matthew Sides, Luke Bruni

Project Definition

Create an app for ZSL that teaches students how greenhouse gases are produced and how they affect certain habitats. Students will be required, at the end of the session, to create a pledge of how they can reduce their greenhouse footprint.
Project Specification

ZSL has given us the task of creating a web based application for children aged 11-16 which will be used in their climate change sessions. The purpose of the app is to teach students how greenhouse gases are produced and the effects they have of habitats and show them what they/society can do to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases. The app will need to include 4 habitats with their own greenhouse chain that will be displayed to the user: Artic (Plastic Bottles), British Wildlife(Beef), Ocean (Leaving electronics on standby/oil rigging), rainforest (Mobile phones). At the end of the app students will need to create ‘pledges’ of how they will reduce their greenhouse footprint.

Schedule:

-Monday 2nd-Sunday 8th: Create Idea for project

-Monday 9th- Sunday 15th: Create Pitch for project 

-Monday 16th October: First Review

-Monday 16th- Sunday 29th: Develop demo for app and design product design document

-Monday 30th October: Second Review

-Tuesday 7th November: Final Presentation

#### Monday 2nd- 8th
We first started with a 1 hour sprint to put our ideas together, we began brainstorming ideas of what the main gameplay of the game would be. We decided to go with an item finding game where the user would have to find certain items in environments, which would give the user information based on each item (how greenhouse gases are created by the item etc.). We also decided on a main menu where the user would be able to decide which environment they would be using (this would depend on the environment table they are at in the ZSL session). We then spent the rest of the week fine tuning this idea and creating concepts of how the app interface would look. In our second sprint on the 5th we then decided on the aesthetic of the app, we decided upon using a comic book style as we felt that would be appealing for the children using the app.

This week’s sprints first started with our group meeting and discussing what we had achieved before the first week, Luke Shead had created the pitch presentation, Joe and Matthew had created some storyboards of how the app would function, Luke Bruni had created some concept art of the main menu and the artic habitat background and Sam had started the backlog of the previous sprints we had completed. Once we had confirmed that the tasks from last week were complete, we then assigned each other tasks that we needed to complete within a 45 minute timeframe (See in table sprint 1). This sprint was focused on our pitch and adding details to certain parts of our pitch, for example we needed to add more details to our storyboard to include the part where the students would give their pledges. Once we had completed the tasks we took an hour break then moved onto our second sprint. This sprint was more focused on how we would manage our project (see in table sprint 2); a way we are doing this is by creating user stories, so we have clear simple tasks that we can complete in our sprints.

## Design [2]

### Concept [2.1]

The concept behind the project is to produce a game which suits the client’s requirements, creating an educational application that is informative, engaging and interactive based on the proposed or pre-set subject (In this instance; Greenhouse gases, production, Manufacturing and the impact of said gases and manufacturing or production phases on the environment in addition to the influence on climate change).

### Story [2.2]

The story relates to the green house gases and chain, of the production and manufacturing process of four products to four habitats. The user is presented with the production and manufacturing process or segments of the green house gas chain and are then responsible or asked to recreate the chain after viewing the process once. Moreover once the chain is completed the user is then presented with what could be done to help alleviate the problem or rate at which green house gases are emitted, which links in to the pledges the user is then shown and asked to pick at least one pledge to enact in their daily lives.

### Setting [2.3] 

This game will be set in the present/modern day.

### Application Structure[2.4]

The Menu will consist of four images, each representing a different area or environment. 
In the application all areas will be unlocked automatically to give the user a choice as to which area they may want to begin with.

Furthermore the graphic styles within the environments and menu will be consistent throughout, though what is represented within each area and the colour palette will change so that differentiation may be made for the 4 different areas (Tundra, Rain Forest, British countryside and the Ocean).

Once an area or habitat has been clicked on a comic strip will be shown spanning one to two scenes (pages) showing the manufacturing and production process of a product relevant to that environment. Moreover after the comic strips have faded the game screen will appear with an empty chain and numerous drag-able images, which need to be put by a user in a specific order. 
After the green house gas chain has been completed and put into the correct order, more images are presented showing what could be done to help alleviate the amount of gases released, with pledges then being presented once the images have been removed from the screen with the user given a choice.
Moreover once a pledge has been chosen the user will then be taken (transitioned) back to the main menu screen.

### Player | Platform [2.5]

The application will adhere to 11-16 year olds, being compatible on the following system;
Apple-IPAD-IOS-Chrome
The application itself though not built with multiplayer, may be used by multiple people through sharing one system or machine and  straightforward discussion  (as to what should be inputted).

### Genre [2.6]
2D
Educational
Memory Game

### Intended Audience[2.7]

The intended audience of the game is for casual or non-gamers of all genders spanning from the age of 11 to 16, however the primary age range is 11 to 12 years old.


### Sound Consideration[2.8]

The game is not sound dependant since it was requested by the client(no sound or audio).

### Language [2.9]

The only language available in the game will be English.

### Camera [2.9.1.]

The camera will be projected from a 2D front side angle of the menu, comics, pledges  and chain.

### General Movement [2.9.2]

The users will be able to drop and drag certain objects across the screen (for the chain segment).
Whilst users will also be able to use the tap function (on the menu and comic slides to transition between scenes).

### Fonts[2.9.3]

In game Font: 
Jupiter (Menu, Game Screen)
.... (Comic Font)

### In Game Text[2.9.4]

Rain Forest | Mobile Phone Comic Strip | Production Green House Gas Chain-
1. Mining takes place in the forest which releases carbon as oil drilling rigs and mines are constructed, installed and run to extract raw materials which are mainly native to rainforests.
2. The raw materials are then transported to factories in China, Taiwan, Japan or Korea releasing carbon in the process.
3. In theses factory's raw materials are made into usable phone parts, releasing carbon as electricity is generated in the process. 
4. The mobile phones are then packaged releasing more carbon.
5. During transportation of the phones to the phone shop further carbon is released.
6. In the Phone shop electricity powers lights, computers, heating, water and many more resources produce excess amounts of carbon. 
7. Carbon is also released as customers travel to the phone shop.
8. Once the phone is purchased and plugged in to charge additional carbon is excelled. 
9.More carbon is released as more resources are mined if the phone is not recycled creating a cycle.   
Rainforest Comic Strip | Images | Shows 3 things that could be done - 
what can be done: 
Recycle old Mobile Phones 
Take Better care of the Phone
Reconsider upgrading if the phone works ok
British Countryside |Beef Comic strip |Production Greenhouse Gas Chain-
1. trees and plants are cut down to make space for cows and to grow their feed thus releasing Greenhouse Gases.
2. Carbon is also  released from pesticides that are put on cow feed to stop them being damaged by pests. Even the production of pesticides produces greenhouse gases.
3. Carbon and nitrous oxide are released from fertilisers that are used to help cow feed grow.
 4. when electricity pumps water from rivers/reservoirs/streams etc. to provide drink for the cows and to water their feed in the fields more carbon is released.
5. Carbon is also released when farm vehicles and machinery are used on the farm and fields.
6. Methane is also released when grazing cows pass wind. 
7. During transportation of livestock to slay, carbon is released when.
8 Electricity powers such as fridges, lights, computers, water and m more resources found in a slaughter house release carbon.
9. From the production of the materials used to package the beef carbon is released.
10. When beef is transported to the shops and restaurants carbon is released. Sometimes it is flown over from a different country!
11. Carbon is released as electricity powers fridges, lights, computers, heating, water and many more resources in the shops and restaurants. 
12. Additional carbon released as customers travel to the shops and restaurants.
13. Methane is released as beef and packaging decomposes in landfill.
Countryside Comic Strip | Images | Shows 3 things that could be done - 
What can be done:
eat less beef (skip eating beef for one day a week)
throw beef and any other food if possible in a special waste bin
When ordering food pick an alternative meat instead of beef (or a vegetarian option)
Ocean | Plastic Bottle comic strip |production Green House gas chain-
1. As drilling rigs are constructed, installed and run carbon is released. 
2. Carbon is also further released as oil is transported via pipes/ships to treatment plants.
3.  Electricity is then required to clean the oil releasing more carbon.
4. As oil is transported via pipes/ships/rail/tankers to manufacturers additonal Carbon is released.
5. Further carbon is released when electricity is generated to form the oil into plastic bottles and lids.
6. The empty bottles are then transported to a bottling plant generating more carbon.
7. machinery then fills the empty bottles with drink releasing more carbon!
8. Carbon is also released during packaging.
9. After Packaging more carbon is released as plastic bottles are transported to shops and restaurants.
10. Electrical powers like fridges, lights, computers, heating, water and many more resources in the shops and restaurants cause more carbons to be released. 
11.Moreover Carbon is released as customers travel to the shops and restaurants.
12. Methane is also released as plastic bottle decomposes in landfill.

1. Natural gas drilling rigs are constructed, installed and run in the Tundra, which releases carbon.
2. natural gas is then transported via pipes/ships/tankers to treatment plants releasing more carbon.
3. Carbon is also released as electricity is required to clean and dry the natural gas. 
4. Natural gas is usually odorised so people can smell it and be alerted to a gas leak, though this causes the release of carbon.
5. As natural gas is transported via pipes/ships/tankers to power stations in the UK further carbon is excelled. 
6. The natural gas is then burned in power stations to drive turbines, which then produces electricity but also releases carbon in the process.
7. Additionally carbon is  released as electricity is needed for pylons/power lines to carry electricity. 
8. 15kg of carbon waster per year by leaving TV on standby.

## Evalutation [3]

### Application Alterication [3.1]

Throughout the early stages of development the applications design was based around and concieved as a puzzle game under the guise of global warming, green house gases and focusing on the impact that the gases and global warming as a whole have on the enviroment. Through communciation and during the first presentation of the conceptual design, it was apparent that the specifications the client had set had been miscontruded partly due to misscommunication and misenterpretation. This was later rectified (sanctified) through asking questions and re-viewing the documentation provided to us by ZSL, along with the notes taken during the first meeting with ZSL. 

Thus using said resources avaliable on hand to formulate a new design based around the feedback given and points highlighted in the orginal documentation and notes last glanced over.Thereafter creating the framework for the demo, design documentation and another mini presentation showcasing said new ideas to a ZSL employee named Michelle that visited during production. Though this caused some time to be lost and could have been easily avoided if the correct questions were asked and anwsers noted in the first place, whilst in continuation with the previous point if the brief provided was properly read. Furthermore the label of a game was footed into the groups head, thus making the majority of the people and other groups involved thinking that game elements were required to be involved when in actuality all that was needed was slight interactivity and information displayed on screen (an application not a game).

### How user and software requirements have been addressed (Generalised) [3.2]

User and software requirements have been addressed through concurrent anaylisis seperating and following an infrastructured system that details the overall expectation, then breaking down said initiative into a few EPICS, thereafter anaylising all the aspects of the EPICS and turning them into key components or stories and tasks of what the user would expect from the software, further making it easier to define the softwares functions and oversee the project through management and production, with said stories being another way to define the tasks that require undertaking to meet what was set during the formation of said projects EPICS. Thereafter the once all the tasks have been completed it would also mean the completion of said EPICS and therefore mean that the initiative should be met.

Incontinuation of the points above the use of such a breakdown methodlogy also makes it easier to define and form the software requirements as what the user would want or expect is thought and therefore what is required to be built into the software is formed through the user requirements. Moreover the user and software requirements also further the software requirements in or with regards to the software set to be used and applied for production.

The image below pertains or details the hierachy and how user and software requirments are broken down and addressed-


![Alt text](https://github.com/matthewsides/ZSL-Green-House-Menace/blob/master/Project_Breakdown.png?raw=true "Optional Title")


In regards to the ZSL project an example may be seen through the sprints (Iteration where team does the work) in the project backlog, displaying clearly a project break down into tasks that all pertain to the production of the ZSL application.


### Tools and Techniques [3.3]

Tools -

Photoshop -

Photoshop an adobe listed tool was used for graphical manipulation, essentially taking pre-made or shot photos and converting them into game graphics for are own use, the lead graphic designer Luke brundi was in charge of said manipulation and creation of graphics taking  numerous images, merging said images into one layer, then using photoshops pre-set filters to differentiate the images from the originals and ensure that the graphics were applicable and suitable to the asthetic requested and set to be used in the design and creation of the application. 

Github -

The staple of the project and origin for all documentation, github was essentially used to store and  trade documentation between the group, since it was not plausable to expect all group members to be avaliable 24/7 for review of their documentation and work. This was also to ensure work was not misconstruded or misplaced enabling the client full access to the design and management documentation during production so that they may review the current situation and whether there were any minute alterications that may have been needed to be made to better meet their expectations and standards. 

Unity -

The builder for the foundation for the application, unity was used to essentially create and form the application. The reason for Unity being chosen was due to an effective anaylisis or measure of relativity between other IDE's. This showed thhhhat Unity was essentially the most proficent and best option due to unitys wide range of languages avliable, compatability with are and the clinets suystems as well as code snippets and tools that maybe and were used to save and use time more efficently. The  previous point also links in to the following point being that the group was new to the majority of Intergrated development enviroments and therefore unity was chosen due to its ease of use.

Power Point -

Power Point was a crucial aspect for the success of the application and used for the production of numerous presentations throughtout the project, this is evident from when the client first attended to see the conceptual ideas in which the group had thought and construded, a presentation was used for better interpretation the ideas in which the group had thought of and how we would adapt the clients requirements into an application (app form).

Although power point was not only used in the presentation and illustration of conceptual forms, but rather also in the final phase of production, where the group visited the clientele region of operations, in which a demo was presentated along with a power point presentation to better convey the ideas behind and shown in the demo furthering the points made through vocal/verbal communication (talk), giving a visual view and effect.

Further delving into powerpoint as a program and the reasons for using the software to meet certain aspects and complete the project, the ease of use once again played a pivotal role due to all the group members being adept in microsoft applications (as it is ingrained into the system), whilst with recent technological advancements it is possible to collaborate online and work on one document specifically using microsoft applications on google drive, power point being one of said applications. 

Techniques -

Interviews -

Through out the project there were numerous times interviews were held with the client ZSL.The first being a formal introduction lead by michelle, a ZSL employee detailing the standards that ZSL expect as well as the overall specifications. Subsequntly during this interview notes were taken by all acceding or participating groups, asking questions when necessary to get a better idea or outlook as to what the client envisions the final outcome to be. 

Following said interview, another interview held at a later interval or date took place going into detail on the conceptual designs that had been made based on the information gathered and given in the first interview, during this phase information was retrieved, garnering 
feedback based around what was shown to better improve the product to suits the clients needs until the final review.

Subsequently the last interview pertained to the final presentation of the game's ideas and a working demo, in which feedback was once again retrieved and questions thrown out from the client and other people of intrest answered. 

Prototyping -

Protoyping another intergral technique used in the project was applied whilst creating the application in unity, testing was used to quarter of sections of code based on there functionality and purpose to see whether any errors occurred whilst in running, back ups were also saved to ensure that there were no set backs during this phase and throughtout coding. This also ensured that it would be easier to find errors in the programming and system, since if an error did occur it is more likely to either be the new code conflicting with another line of code or an issue within the code chunk (block) itself.

Presentations -

The project required monumental metholodgy,ideology and clear communication to ensure that the clients vision was met to an acceptable standard. This was achieved through excellent vocal skills and visual presentation, using the visual aspect as a way to empower the vocalisation and words spoken about the application giving the client an overall view of are interpretation of there requirements. Further grasping the clients attention using body language and speaking skills to present the work and get the point across, essentially using the presentations held throughout the project as a means of communiction and review with the client to ensure a certain standard was upheld and the final product was sold and acceptable. 

### Motivational theories, contrast and impact on the workplace [3.2]

#### Hierarcy of Needs

The Hierarcy of needs, developed by Psychologist Abraham Maslow, is a motivational theory comprising a five tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. Maslow (1943, 1954) stated that people are motivated to achieve certain needs and that some needs take precedence over others. Moreover once one level is attained it is human nature to move onto the next and what further motivates us.



This five-stage model can be divided into deficiency needs and growth needs. The first four levels are often referred to as deficiency needs (D-needs), and the top level is known as growth or being needs (B-needs).

#### Carrot and Stick

This traditional motivational theory, attributed to philosopher Jeremy Bentham, dates back to around 1800 during the Industrial Revolution. The theory essentially splits motivation into two basic components: incentives and fear.There are instances where some are motivated by material gain,yearning to achieve status and power, comparitive to where some act out of fear of losing their job  being reprimanded by a supervisor or not being able to adequately perform an assignment.


#### Comparsion and Impact

The relation and differences between the two motivational theories above essentially pertain to the factors that lead to motivation and the driving forces behind said motivation, as briefly explained above, "the Carrot and Stick theory essentially splits motivation  into two compentents: Incentives and fear", similiar to the Hierarcy of Needs the first few (two-three) tiers in the pyramid model refer to survival and the following that factors that trail behind the lack of ability to access the basic needs to survive are fear and incentive, thus it is easy to relate the two theorys in the beggining tiers (D-needs) of the Hierarcy of Needs model. 

Though in comparision to the carrot and stick theory, the Hierarcy of Needs covers a more indepth analysis into what may motivate someone not just briefly stating that incentive and fear are the driving forces behind motivation, but splitting the theory into a 
five layered ordered model, pertaining to the idea that certain needs take precidence over others for instance physiological needs must first be met before security needs and not vice versa. 

Thereafter the theories do not clash but rather collate, with the Hierarcy of Needs theory merely exapanding on the Carrot and Stick
motivational theory formed in the 1800's, delving more into the incentives one may crave (self fufilment, Pyschological needs,Basic Needs) and the fears one may experience during a peroid of work (stress).

In relation to the ZSL Project and own experience, the theorys can be seen to have a huge impact, deemed important , as during the project there were numerous instances in which we were behind and this is where the idea of fear that leads motivation can be seen (may be noted that this was particuarly prominent after the first presentation when morale was low and work was stagment, it took the idea or fear of not having anything to present in the next meeting and failing to meet expectations to motivate the group further). Whilst the incentives in this regard pertain to the fifth and fourth level, particuarly of self actualization and Esteem needs, as the ZSL opportunity beckoned competition and growth, with the chosen group being able to present their work and see their application used in a proffessional manner. 

Therefore it may be seen that the motivational theories play an integral role and severely impact work produced, however the differences in the worked produced out of fear and incentives being different in the sense that depending on the situation the quality of work produced may be different regardless of whether either of the theorys idealogical basis.

### Importance of team dynamics in the success and/or failure of group work [3.4]

Team dynamics is integral to the success or failure of any project and its management, in particular in relation to the ZSL project entrusting that everyone knew their part was crucial especially since there were multiple intervals where the group was unable to meet with eachother due to extended breaks (half-term) , furthermore if communication was not kept and team dynamics not applied it would be likely that work is duplicated or that one member may go off track. For instance in the first draft the drawn artwork and graphical artwork differed greatly due to a lack of communication and thus caused inconsistency in the graphics overall look.

Moreover during the extended break the group was expected to organise times as to when to come in doing the equivalent to overtime to ensure that the groups were on target for a time deference already below the usual industry standards as to what would be coined as acceptable or reasonable. This was not done due to a lack of euthusiam of one member, no communication by two, whilst the team leader was not taking charge, stating that they were busy, thus leaving the team with one member (me) having to arrange a date for the group to meet up (a job meant for the team leader), which did not happen meaning one member was left attending or coming in on monday and tuesday, to  hoist the group to an acceptable standard of work within that time (which did not happen), leaving that one member to not enjoy their work (morale decreased and not come in the wenesday of that week as was origninally attended), hence another reason why team dynamics is important as it may affect performance. 

Furthermore team dynamics may not just affect the success or failure of said group work or one project but a company's overall reputation, the company in this instance being Reboot games which I am under, where the first draft was not up to the clients (ZSL) standards (meeting around 40%) missing the core point of the application and areas they wished covered, thus in a competetive enviroment it is likely that the client would not invest into the company's app but rather another organisation that may sate their needs. This being mainly caused by the lack of communicaton not just internally but externally with the client, whilst if the documentation was read thoroughly, the group communicated and committed it would have been less likely for the mistake to occur as the project would have been less rushed with multiple people working on it and the group/team working inconjunction. Inaddition the team dynamics affect on reputation may also cause a drought of influx of money as work is less likely to come through and with staff morale falling due to not applying team dynamics, the staff retention rates and quality of work will go down. This therefore highlighting the importance of team dynamics and the insufficent use of the methodlogy in this project thus showing flaws and room for improvement.

The success that team dynamics bring is essentially the vice versa to what is covered in the previous and above paragraphs, allowing people to have high morale, work meets standards, excellent reputation as work is delivered, retention of staff, constant secure/safe flow of money and team and individual performance improving. Which can been seen more in the second draft as their was more communication after getting feedback from the client and people completed the work allocated and based around the time given or remaining for completion a acceptable outcome was achieved, though not chosen, the use of team dynamics and effect may be observed and the project can be deemed succesful in the scope of meeting the clients standards, though evidently a failure for the group not being chosen, which in a sense shows the flaws and leaves room for development.

### Critical Evalutation of self contribution [3.5]

In relation to my own self contribution to the project, I believe in regards to the first draft I was integral to some of the key concepts thought up , though not as useful in the documentation of said concept, instead opting to handle the storyboard aspect as to how the game may function and look, though as explained in the above section (Importance of team dynamics in the success and/or failure of group work) the whole team dynamic was not functioning to an acceptable standard and thus confusion ensued as to the graphical outlook of the game and thus a re-evaulation of said drawings was required to ensure consistency with other graphics made by another group member.Furthermore I took attempted to take on roles that were supposed to be covered by the team leader,organising meetings during breaks, though not successful this shows the lack of team dynamic and room for improvement. Although in the (second meeting with the client) meeting where the first draft was introduced and presented to the client I contributed slightly to the answering of questions though maybe not necessary it helped relive the pressure of the chosen presenter of are group.

Furthermore in relation to the contribution for the second draft I believe the contribution I garned was integral and significant as the main core coneceptual idea was thought up by me, with the game design documentation, text documentation and the majority of the applications core features, excluding the graphics were covered and developed by me, thus allowing the client to see visual development and also a finished product within the time limit set by the client. That is not to say that the group did not have a hand in said development, but shows that I had an evident and significant impact on the final outcome of the project application.

Moreover following the critical evalutation if I were to undertake a similiar project in the future I would suggest that I work on my time management, communication (required for the whole team/group) and overall handling of the project in the first instance ensuring that the brief is thoroughly read as in the first instance or draft it missed the point as to what the client wanted the application to bring across and be centered around.

### Event and Design evaluation [3.6]

In regards to the event it was  satisfactory, producing perhaps not a desiarable outcome but an exceptable one, as a solid idea was layed out to the client meeting the criteria that was talked over with the client days before in a prior meeting before the final event. Whilst although the application prototype failed to function in some areas the base for the application was there showing the client as to what to expect and considerble commitment considering that it was manufactured and put together within a short span of time.

Moreover there was an appliciation of savvy interpersonal skills during the event, showcasing the ideology behind the application, reasons for making the decisions we did and what could have been had more time been allocated.Further communicating with the clients bouncing ideas off eachother and accepting crude criticism as to what they would have liked to have seen or what could have been done to further improve the app. 

Inaddition during the design proccess the first draft and the follow up to the second was lacking in the use of interpersonal skills and actually meeting the clients requirements or standards, which can be seen to be linked with the lack of interpersonal skills and team dynamics within the group. Furthermore the effectiveness of interpersonal skills can be seen through the stark contrast in work covered in the weeks that meetings were held, whilst through comparing the first draft that did not fully meet the clients (ZSL) standards unlike the second idea that was met with favorable feedback.  The lack of interpersonal skills particularly near the beginning of the project can be further seen through the graphical and drawn designs of the application as the drawn designs or storyboards had to be scrapped as it did not meet the asthetic look of the graphical images, thus leading to inconsistency. 

Though the communication between the tutor unlike the group members for the design phase was satisfactory in regards to my own communication though as a group the communication was abysmal as times regarding when work shall be completed were not sent, thus meaning that the tutor could not update the client or know as to what phase the development was at.

Therefore in regards to the standard of the application of interpersonal communication during the design pahse and an event, during the first half of the design phase it was appalling, though improved as the project got into the later stages of the design phase, due to a sense of urgency and obligation to the client to fufill prior promises made, thus enabling the event in particular the use of interpersonal skills to soar as there was an abudant amount of content to cover and talk over with the client, also receving constructive criticsm well and applying a range of techniques such as using body language, a presentation, being verbal, well spoken and applying other proffesional practices to ensure that the group was recieved well and the intent of the group was clearly put across.

### Communciation Styles and Formats applied in the delivery of an event 

A range of different communication styles and formats were used during the event to essentially better convey the groups ideas and points across to the client. For instance verbal communication, effective during the presentation as are groups presenter (in this instance Luke Shead) was consise, stating the ideas behind the design,a walkthrough of the given protoytype also covering the parts ommitted form the project due to time constraints.

In Addition to verbal communication, Visual formats were also used. For example power point, to provide an illustrative backdrop for the content of said presentation and support (back-up) the words spoken by the presenter. Another visual format also enforced was the use of a demo, prepared specifically for this scenario or event. Theses visual formats were essentially used effectively during the event as the inclusion of said demo provided quality assurance and a better illustration as to what the client might expect the finished application to function and look like aesthetically. Whilst the presentation and the way in which it was utilised was effective due to the following of the 6 slide rule, short and concise,stating what the presenting is verbally conveying. Further being used to engage the client, diverting attention off the presenter, thus alleviating the pressure. 

Another communication style applied in the delivery of an event or presentation was body language, used to give an aura of confidence,enthusiasm and assurance ( a specific message to the client). Thereafter sending the message to the clientele that we have the same intrest and are devoted to the continuing and finalising the project.

The underlying reason for the (abtuse) numerous amount of communication styles,methods and formats applied in the deliverly of an event, since people better interpret certain methods of communication than others.

Essentially the communication styles and formats applied were used effectively, conveying and illustrating the points in which the group wanted to transmit. This may be seen through the feedback recieved in emails and during the event (photos), in which ZSL (Michelle, Gareth, etc.) and the invited guest judges lauded the group.

Emails-

### [3.7] Problem solving techniques used in the design and delivery of an event 

The ZSL project hailed the use of numerous problem solving techniques during the design and deliverly of an event, below a few techniques applied are listed-

-Brainstorming: By encouraging the open expression of any and all ideas, the perspective of all those involved in solving the problem can contribute to identifying possible options to solve the problem and then selecting the best solution from those possibilities. This was used multiple times throughtout all stages of development as the group had to design a suitable application that would meet the clients requirements, fleshing out ideas through verbal communication. Whilst another instance where brain storming was used, during group supervision and meetings to convey and discuss constraints or problems that have occured,useing said brain storming as a median and oppoturnity to figure out the origin of the problem. 

-Process evaluation: Problems can be approached by breaking systems into sections which can be analyzed for the source of the problem.Through the implication of SCRUM, Proccess evaluation was sought and seen ideal, being able to work in conjunction with SCRUM, heralding similaities to what a product backlog sprint entails.The ideology and methodology of proccess evalutation was applied numerous times in development as seen through stories, Epics and the product backlog, breaking the requirements down and delegating the seperate tasks to group memembers. While this is also relayed through the aims and objectives and applied during the code implementation as issues occured during development.

-Word analysis: Through focusing on the essential questions; who, what, where, why, when, and how; team members can gather the essential facts about a problem without dealing with confusing details. Word analysis was applied particularly in the first stage of development Whilst formulating a plan,schedule and laying out the first conceptual design. Essentailly focusing on the clients background and what the client wanted to use said application for to gain a better understanding.

-Data collection: By making sure relevant information is collected, team members can develop a more suitable response. This problem solving technique was used shortly after a brief was recieved from ZSL, during requirement gathering making inquirys into what ZSL would expect, querying to essentially feed ideas, making suggestions and gaining a better understanding of the overall expectations to ensure that the response or presentation was prim and proper (met there standards).

In continuation to the problem solving techniques and points covered above the techniques were fudemental and used effectively in the design and deliverly of an event. However this is only inrelation to the later stages of development as the techniques were put into place to ensure that information was gathered and not miscontruded or misinterpretated. Though the opposite happened, thus leading to an application being shown in the second meeting that did not portray what the client wanted. Once reapplied during the review of the current design or version, however information was extracted that was previously glossed over or missed , fixing the erroneous design and problems.

### [3.8] Justification of use of solution Methodologies 

Throughout the project numerous encounters left the group unable to further progress until a solution was found to a certain problem, detailing the problems, methods and solutions, justification for the steps taken when encountered with said problem may be found in the below paragraphs. 

The project was approximently 6 weeks in length, within that time the group was tasked with making an educational application for kids, focusing in particular on the green house gas chain, during the coding  and conceptual design phase of the project one such problem that occurred though not evident until ported to Ipad devices (the chosen system for the applicaiton to run on)  was that the dimesions of the frame outscaled the device, meaning that the application went of screen and certain features were not able to be accessed. 

Thus problem solving meetings occurred to objectively address the issues that threaten the project. This was particuarly benifical as it encouraged open experession with the perspective of all those involved in solving the problem being contributed to identifying possible options to solve the problem and then selecting the best solution from those possibilities.

In correlation to the above method of internal meetings, external outsourcing for solutions through the web and other groups were also carried out, to seek their views and other possible ways to fix a problem, this can be seen to be successful during the project as inrelation to the illustrated problem put out in the second paragraph, one of the groups that was consulted encountered the same problem ealier on in the project and thus helped solve a problem that otherwise would have been elongated. Further illiterating this point the solution involved altering a setting native to the Unity software, which is pre-set until manually changed (resolution setting/option).

With regards to the project as a whole the project itself can be viewed as a problem that the client requires to be solved, thereafter the method of proccess evalution breaking the project down was applied, seperating theses broken tasks and sharing among group members to accomplish, thus ensuring optimal efficency and increasing the rate at which the project as a whole would be completed. The use of this method can be further justified as through proccess evaluation in particular to the latter stage of the project enabled a solid idea to come to fruition. 


### [3.9] Critique of the proccess used to give critical Reasoning 

The method or proccess applied to anaylse and question the steps taken through out the project or more specifically critically assess the thought proccess behind said actions,consisted of considering  whether the choice made was approriate, also further questioning as to if there were any other alternatives to said decision before and after application. Moreover then reading through the documented plan  and researching as to what could have been improved upon, other methods or ideas that can or could have been used, essentially comparing or using other documented information relating to what is being overlooked and seeing as to what method or ideology would have or better suits the situation and work. 

In regards as to the steps that could have been taken to further improve the critique proccess, rather than just analysing documented information or written work, vocal or verbal feedback could have helped influencing decisions and aiding the evaulation of work using critical reasoning, getting a more solid idea as to the hidden problems with said planning and decisions rather than just comparing work (second opinion), ensuring the same mistakes are not encountered on future projects.
